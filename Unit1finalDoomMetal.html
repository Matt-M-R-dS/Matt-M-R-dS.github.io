        <h2>A Short Explanation</h2>
        <p>Doom Metal is a metal subgenre which is easily identified by how incredibly slow paced the vast majority of it is. Songs are long and riffs are low pitched. Unsurprisingly, the genre is frequently associated with stoners and potheads.</p>

        <h2>Black Sabbath</h2></center>
        <p class="leftfloatparagraph">Black Sabbath is widely considered to be the first metal band ever. If your parents are younger than 55, Black Sabbath is older than them, and has done way cooler things than them regardless of their age. As a band, they forged the path for the entirety of metal, and most particularly wrote some of the first ever music in the subgenre of doom metal. As a band, they have had two of the most influential metal singers of all time, those being Ozzy Osbourne and Ronny James Dio (rest in peace sweet prince), both of whom had incredibly successful careers even outside of the band. One of Black Sabbath's most well known songs, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3IOQZRcEkplCXg6LofKqE9" target="_blank"><em>Iron Man,</em></a> is a perfect display of all things doom metal, with another incredible example coming in the form of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2bku1YWarHpKlxVC2FB9dH" target="_blank"><em>Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.</em></a></p>

        <center><h2 class="afterfloat">Electric Wizard</h2></center>
        <p class="rightfloatparagraph">Electric Wizard is an incredible preservation of the doom metal genre. Despite coming about 30 years after Black Sabbath, they still hold true to the original doom metal structure. Being the frequently-proclaimed "heaviest band in the universe," they utilize some incredibly low, distorted guitar riffs and crackly vocals which feel straight out of an old phonograph. They are best known for their album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1AxwLCMtx8rnIxkFQKU2LO" target="_blank"><em>Dopethrone,</em></a> which features incredible songs such as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6DU1WKdUnR7OZkw7BZl9P0" target="_blank"><em>Funeralopolis.</em></a> This is not the extent of their greatest work however, as other pieces such as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7hxZUYlclkrFO7MpJQj5Ff" target="_blank"><em>Return Trip</em></a> are equally as amazing.</p>
