        <h2>A Short Explanation</h2>
        <p>Progressive Metal, or "Prog" for short is a genre played by people who are complete musical geniuses. It is easily one of the most difficult genres of music ever to exist, and requires an extremely vast knowledge of music theory. However, the fans of this genre are generally considered to be one or more of a few things:</p></center>
        <ul>
            <li>Losers</li>
            <li>Stuck up know-it-alls</li>
            <li>Nerds</li>
            <li>People who smell really, really bad</li>
        </ul>
        <center><p>Even still, with these facts in mind, they cannot ruin the incredible skill of those who perform the genre, or ruin the beauty of it to those who choose to enjoy it.</p>

        <h2>Tool</h2></center>
        <p class="leftfloatparagraph">Tool is a band that was formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1990. They are highly revered for their incredibly complex musicianship, using strange and unheard of time signaitures, interesting techniques, and unusual themes, often relating to drugs. An example of such is their song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7tvuLLroI0n6uYBWuFig5d" target="_blank"><em>Lateralus,</em></a> which is heavily inspired by the mathematical fibonnaci sequence. The syllables in each line of the lyrics slowly ascend and descend the sequence, and the chorus uses a time signaiture pattern of 9/8, 8/8 and 7/8, which forms the 16th number of the sequence, 987. For reasons like this, many consider listening to Tool to be more of an audio experience rather than simply just listening to a band. Really, that makes no sense. but people say it anyways, because why not.</p>

        <center><h2 class="afterfloat">Dream Theater</h2></center>
        <p class="rightfloatparagraph">Dream Theater is a band made up of by-far some of the most skilled musicians on the planet. However, unlike Tool, who show their musicianship with their wacky time signaitures and strange concepts, Dream Theater shows their musical prowess with raw, instrumental talent. Their songs are incredible expressions of emotion and feeling, mixed with beautiful lyrical storytelling. Some of their more notable pieces are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1UQn05L6LCftnI9VoNy4Sp" target="_blank"><em>6:00</em></a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5axwj3ekvw85989jjO8Ov8" target="_blank"><em>Panic Attack.</em></a> Both are incredible displays of musicianship from each member of the band.</p>
