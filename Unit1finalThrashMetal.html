        <h2>A Short Explanation</h2>
        <p>Thrash metal is a subgenre categorized most notably by its fast paced songs and aggressive sounding riffs. Lyrically, thrash metal tends to focus on anti-establishmental beliefs. As a subgenre, it came into its own in the mid 80's, with the rise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal#:~:text=The%20genre%20was%20commercially%20successful,Four%22%20of%20U.S.%20thrash%20metal." target="_blank">Big Four.</a></p>

        <h2>Metallica</center></h2>
        <p class="leftfloatparagraph">Metallica is a band which was formed in Los Angeles California, in the year 1981. The band originally was made up of the four members James Hetfield (vocals and rhythm guitar), Lars Ulrich (drums), Cliff Burton (bass), and Dave Mustaine (lead guitar). The bands lineup would change two years later, when Dave Mustaine was kicked out after the release of the first album, <em>Kill 'Em All,</em> for being a violent alcoholic and drug abuser. He would later start his own band, <strong>Megadeth.</strong> He would be replaced by the guitarist Kirk Hammett. The band lineup would go on to release two more albums with its lineup unchanged, until the tragic death of their bassist, Cliff Burton, in 1986. He was replaced by Jason Newsted, who would release 5 albums with the band before quitting in 2001. Robert Trujillo would be the next bassist to take up the mantle, and is still with Metallica in the present day. Metallica is by far one of, if not <strong>THE</strong> most well-known metal band in the world. Even people who have never thought themselves fans of the band have certainly heard songs such as <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/54bm2e3tk8cliUz3VSdCPZ" target="_blank">Master of Puppets</a></em> and <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3VqHuw0wFlIHcIPWkhIbdQ" target="_blank">Enter Sandman.</a></em></p>

        <h2 class="afterfloat"><center>Megadeth</center></h2>
        <p class="rightfloatparagraph">Megadeth is a band that has had too many members to count, with the only constant being its founder, lead guitarist and vocalist, Dave Mustaine. The band is known for its impressive guitar solo and riff work, as well as Mustaine's impossible-to-describe voice. Writing anything about the band's history would be hell considering it has more former members than a standard-sized millitary battalion, this paragraph will focus on the album <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4e6ML9RBhDyyKTaTwbiRZv" target="_blank">Rust in Peace.</a></em> Released by Megadeth in 1990, it is considered by many to be the single greatest piece of music media of all time. That is of course, heavily debated upon, but has earned this fame for good reason. With songs such as <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4GMQOjbWshf4Mzphkjg0DJ" target="_blank">Tornado of Souls</a></em> and <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0bM9c5A7CterSOEssmWqAa" target="_blank">Holy Wars... The Punishment Due,</a></em> the album is an incredibly impressive show of guitar work rivalled by very few albums at the time.</p>
