        <h2>A Short Explanation</h2>
        <p>NWOBHM Is an acronym which stands for "New Wave Of British Heavy Metal". This was used to describe the heavy metal music coming out of britain in the late 70's and early 80's. This form of metal is actually pretty easy to identify, as there are only really two things that categorize it:</p></center>
        <ol>
            <li>Is the band British?</li>
            <li>Are the members geriatric?</li>
        </ol>
        <center><p>If the answer to both of these questions is yes, then congratulations! You just found an NWOBHM band!</p>

            <h2>Iron Maiden</h2></center>
            <p class="leftfloatparagraph">Iron Maiden is a major anomaly in the metal genre. Usually, after about 10-20 years, a band that began in the 80's tends to start sucking. Their new music is boring, no one likes it, their singer cannot hit the high notes anymore (Axl Rose), and so on. But Iron Maiden is not that. They still rock. No matter where you look on their music catalogue, you will find something incredible. From <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2SrVGpjv0mqCR6j9EZPSm2" target="_blank"><em>2 Minutes to Midnight</em></a> to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/20sXcaJkWP0DdzA58Colw3" target="_blank"><em>The Writing on the Wall,</em></a> You would struggle to find a song that is not at the very least decent. Alike the historical events they sing about, Iron Maiden has withstood the test of time.</p>

            <center><h2 class="afterfloat">Motorhead</h2></center>
            <p class="rightfloatparagraph">Motorhead is a band best known for their song <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3CIOopLwvyMvXk97ZEksKO" target="blank"><em>Ace of Spades,</em></a> but that will not be discussed in this paragraph. What <strong><u>WILL</u></strong> be discussed is the band's frontman, Lemmy Kilmister. Firstly, one of either "Lemmy" or "Kilmister" is a stage name, and its not the one you think. This man's last name is Kilmister. He was born to rock. On top of that, he basically lived the phrase sex, drugs and rock and roll. He was the most rocking man in the world until his untimely demise in 2014. This was probably caused in part by his severe alcoholism and smoking addiction, which was so bad that for him, "cutting down" was considered one pack of cigarettes and five vodkas a day. On top of speed. He is still not in the Rock and Roll hall of fame, which is absurd. Anyways, with the shameless Lemmy lovin' out of the way, Motorhead was one of the pioneers of metal. While they are today sometimes considered no more than hard rock, their impact on the genre is undeniable, and they will always have a place in the metal community.</p>
