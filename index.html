        <h2>Introduction</h2> </center>
        <p>Metal. A genre frequently associated with screaming, ear-shatteringly loud volume, and violent teens and adolescents. With lyrics frequently pertaining to crimes, drinking, drug abuse and other similar topics, it is easy to see how the genre got its reputation. But the thing is, metal is not one genre, in which all music shares one lyrical theme. Metal is an umbrella term for many different genres, which all manage to be different in their own way. Rather than sing about murder, some genres tend to vocalize environmental issues or political problems. In some extents, comparing one genre to another can be like comparing apples to thermonuclear bombs. This website's purpose is to educate those with little knowledge on the subject, and help them to learn the differences.</p>
