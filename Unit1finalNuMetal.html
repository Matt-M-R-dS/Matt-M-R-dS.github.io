This page acts as the second of five deeper dives into specific genres and bands, linked off of my main website. It will focus primarily on nu-metal, and the bands Korn and Slipknot. at the bottom of the page, there will be a link back to the home page.-->

        <h2>A Short Explanation</h2>
        <p>Nu-Metal is a subgenre which first emerged in the late 90s' and early 2000's. It is characterized by its mixture of standard metal and hip hop elements, with vocals being more typically presented in a rapping style. singers also make use of different vocal techniques to add strange and indescribable noises to their songs.</p>

        <h2>Korn</h2></center>

        <p class="leftfloatparagraph">Korn is one of many bands to emerge to the nu-metal scene in its early days. Their most well known song is called <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6W21LNLz9Sw7sUSNWMSHRu" target="_blank">Freak on a Leash,</a></em> and features some of the most deep and meaningful lyrics ever to come to a metal song. They go as follows:<br>
            <span id="freakonaleash">"Boom na da noom na nanema<br>
            Da boom na da noom na namena<br>
            Da boom na ba noom na namena<br>
            Da boom na da noom na namena<br>
            Da boom na ba noom na namena<br>
            Da boom na da noom na namena<br>
            Da boom na ba noom na namena<br>
            Da boom na da noom na namena<br>
            Da boom na ba noom na namena<br>
            Da boom na da noom na namena<br>
            Da boom na ba noom na namena<br>
            Da boom na da noom na namena"</span><br>
            In all reality, the gibberish displayed above is one of Korn's most well-known trademarks. Their singer, Jonathan Davis makes random, almost animalistic noises in the middle of songs for no reason. It is hilarious, and one of the many factors that draw people to the band.</p>

        <center><h2 class="afterfloat">Slipknot</h2></center>
        <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/25/259725-050-30930DF8/Slipknot-heavy-metal-band-masks-2000.jpg" alt="9 silly guys" class="leftfloatphoto">
        <p id="rightfloatparagraphslipknot">Slipknot is a band made up of an absurd 9 members who rose to fame in 1999 with the release of their self titled album. Their music is loud, angry and violent to no end, with vocalist Corey Taylor screaming his lyrics of hate over all the cacophony. Slipknot famously was a rather disgusting band for birth of their career and the years following it, which gave them a sort of cult following amongst the unwashed masses. Such stories include the aptly named Crow Story. However, despite the band's clear lack of any amount of care for their health, they have prevailed and created truly incredible music. Songs like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/61mWefnWQOLf90gepjOCb3" target="_blank"><em>Duality</em></a> have such raw emotion and power behind them which many other bands would struggle to muster.</p>
        <div id="crowstory"><h2><center>The Crow Story</center></h2><p><span id="redtext"><center></center>NOTE: This story is mildly disturbing. Read at your own discretion.</center></span><br>One day, on while parking his car, Shawn Crahan, founding member and percussionist of the band Slipknot, came across a dead crow on his driveway. Being the rational and completely sane gentleman that he is, Shawn did the sensible thing and scooped the crow into a jar, bringing it to the next band practice. His bandmates, rather than being horrified at the sight of the dead animal presented before them, thought it was hilarious, and the bird became an honourary 10th member of the band. The bird would be at every practice for the next while, and the band would even bring it to gigs. Eventually, they began opening the lid and huffing the fumes before every show, as a tradition. They would even sometimes bring it out on stage to show the fans, who seemed to love it. This all came to an end when at one concert, the fans began chanting "give us the bird." when Shawn Crahan obliged and handed the jar to his fans, they immediately opened it and begun to scoop out the now long dead bird with their bare hands, eating it in its entirety. This would lead to all Slipknot fans now being referred to as maggots.</p></div>
